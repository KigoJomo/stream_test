# ü§ñ Stream Test: Because Why Not?

> Because watching text appear character by character is _way_ more entertaining than binge-watching Netflix.

## What's This All About?

This is my adventure into the wonderful world of AI response streaming. Why? Well, why not? I had some time to kill, and watching AI responses materialize letter by letter seemed like a perfectly reasonable way to spend it. Plus, it's oddly satisfying ‚Äì like watching paint dry, but for nerds.

## Features

- ‚ú® Real-time AI response streaming (because waiting for the whole response is so 2023)
- üé® TailwindCSS styling (because raw CSS is for masochists)
- üöÄ Next.js powered (because that's what all the cool kids are using)
- üß† Actually learned something (surprising, right?)

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript (because JavaScript with superpowers)
- Next.js (for that sweet, sweet server-side rendering)
- TailwindCSS (for making things pretty without crying)
- AI Magic ‚ú® (the real MVP here)

## What I Learned

1. How to make AI talk slower (technically, stream responses)
2. That watching text appear gradually is weirdly addictive
3. TypeScript is your friend (most of the time)
4. Building something just for fun is actually... fun?

## Running Locally

```bash
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone https://github.com/KigoJomo/stream_test.git

# Install dependencies (there's probably a lot)
npm install

# Fire it up
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and watch the magic happen. Or don't. I'm not your boss.

Feel free to contribute! Though, let's be honest, this was mainly a "because I can" project. But if you want to make it better, who am I to stop you?
